          <p class="lead"></p>

          <p>English language learners take up 8.8% of all enrolled students in the state of Connecticut. This term refers to students whose first language at home is not English. Meaning, while they are being educated, they are also involved in learning a new language. These students deserve attention which is why I have gone through the process of researching more details about their enrollment rates at different school types by towns and how per pupil spending is related to enrollment percentages by district. I have focused on the top 8 highest student populated towns in Connecticut and focused on which types of schools are most popular for English learners. The following school types I found data for are public, magnet, charter, program and then grouped the others into one category. We can see which school types are more popular, containing a majority of English learners and compare this to the types of schools that have a smaller population of English language learners. I also looked into how percent of enrolled English language learners compares to the per pupil spending by district. I found data for the central 33 school districts to distinguish a trend. 

These two questions can help us understand a general story about English language learners. Through research, results have shown public schools are the most popular school type for English language learners from the eight towns I looked into. With the other school types accounting for a smaller amount of enrolled English language learners in these 8 towns. I also found a relationship between enrollment percentages and per pupil spendings. The general trend shows as percentage increases, per pupil spending decreases. Drawing all this information allows us to see the education style and expenses for English language learners.

          <h2>Data</h2>
          
          <p>From the 8 towns researched, the most popular school types for English language learners are public schools. The stacked bar chart below shows a visual of how many English language learners are enrolled in each of these towns, broken up by school type. Each school type is coded to a different color, making it easy to see how much of the total enrollment in that town it takes up. The blue indicates other, which is all other school types of the population combined. This can include school types such as college affiliated, CT technical education and career, open choice and others. The lengths of the bars show how largely populated each town is. When looking at the chart, there is a majority of red for each bar. This indicates a large percent of English language learners for each town attend public schools. We see that a small portion of these bars is taken up by all other school types. These results can prove the lack of...</p>

          <p>For the second question, I also used data from EdSight, this time under the per-pupil spending page. After I had downloaded the data onto a google sheet and cleaned it up, I imported it to a data wrapper and created a scatter plot chart. A scatter plot chart does a great job of comparing two variables and visually portraying their relationship to each other. English language learner enrollment percentage is on the horizontal axis of this chart and per pupil spending is on the vertic al axis. Thos setup allows the enrollment percentage to be the independent variable, and per pupil spending the dependent variable and how it changes due to the percentage. Each blue dot on the chart represents a different district and when put all together a general trend can be formed.  I created a tooltip to display the district name, per pupil spending, and percent of English language learners enrolled. As the viewer drags their cursor over each blue dot, a pop up will read these three key pieces of information. ch blue dot, a pop up will read these three key pieces of information. Looking at the map below, the trend line indicates a slight decreasing relationship between the two variables. This can help us understand generally, with a higher percentage of english learners enrolled, there is a smaller per pupil spending.  Also from the chart, we gain a sense of where the majority of blue dots fall. This can help us understand that most districts have an enrollment percentage of English language learners from 0 percent to 10 percent and it is clear that most per pupil spending ranges from $12,000 to $25,000. </p>

          <h2>Section 4: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>
